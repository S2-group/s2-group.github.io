Imagine a world where you make a conscious choice every time you upload a file to the Cloud towards a greener planet. That's the ambitious vision behind the [Think Before You Save](https://github.com/adam-bouafia/Think-Before-You-Save) project by [Adam Bouafia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adam-bouafia-b597ab86/), a student of the 2024/2025 edition of the Green Lab course who is attending the GSEEM international track of the Computer Science Master program at VU Amsterdam.

The [Think Before You Save](https://github.com/adam-bouafia/Think-Before-You-Save) project is the winner of the Green IT category in the recent [Green Waves Hackathon](https://www.tudelft.nl/climate-action/agenda/green-waves-hackathon-sustainable-it-water) organized by TU Delft's Climate Action Programme.

The Green Waves Hackathon, held in November 2024, aimed to develop innovative solutions for a more sustainable future, specifically focusing on Sustainable IT and Water. Among the many creative projects, Think Before You Save stood out for its simple-but-effective approach to tackling the environmental impact of digital activities.

**What is Think Before You Save?**

This project proposes a browser extension that raises awareness about the energy consumption associated with saving files online. We all know cloud storage is convenient, but the constant syncing and data transfer have a hidden environmental cost. Think Before You Save aims to make this cost visible and encourage users to be more mindful about their digital footprint.

**How Does it Work?**

The extension integrates seamlessly with your web browser. When you go to save a file, it displays an estimated energy consumption for the upload process. This serves as a gentle nudge to consider if the file truly needs to be saved online or if alternative options like local storage or compressed formats would be more sustainable.

**Benefits and Potential Impact**

Think Before You Save offers a simple yet powerful way to promote responsible digital behavior. By making the environmental impact of online actions transparent, users can make informed decisions about their cloud storage habits. This could lead to:
- Reduced energy consumption: With conscious choices, we could collectively lower the energy footprint associated with cloud storage.
- Increased awareness of digital sustainability: The project sparks a conversation about the environmental implications of technology use, encouraging a broader shift towards sustainable digital practices.
- Promoting alternative storage solutions: Think Before You Save could motivate users to explore local storage options or compressed formats, further reducing reliance on energy-intensive cloud storage.

**Looking Forward**

While the project is currently in its early stages (you can find the code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/adam-bouafia/Think-Before-You-Save)), its potential for impact is promising. Initiatives like the Green Waves Hackathon provide a platform for innovative solutions like Think Before You Save, demonstrating the power of collaborative efforts towards a sustainable future.

The project's success underscores the importance of integrating sustainability considerations into everyday actions. With small but impactful changes in our digital habits, we can all contribute to a greener future, one click at a time.
