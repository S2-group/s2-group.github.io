#### Abstract
Users can today download a wide variety of apps ranging from simple toy games to sophisticated business-critical apps. They rely on these apps daily to perform diverse tasks, some of them related to sensitive information such as their finance or health. Ensuring high-quality, reliable, and secure software is thus key. In the TruX research group of the interdisciplinary center for Security, Reliability, and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg, we have been working for over 10 years to deliver practical techniques, tools, and other artifacts (such as repositories), making the analysis of Android apps possible. In this talk, I will briefly introduce our key contributions to Android app static analysis to detect security issues.
