We’re proud to share that Patricia Lago has been honored with the ICSA 2025 Diversity and Inclusion Award at the [22nd IEEE International Conference on Software Architecture ICSA (ICSA 2025)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2025) held in Odense, Denmark.

This prestigious award recognizes her outstanding and sustained leadership in advancing diversity and fostering an inclusive environment within the software architecture community. Her commitment to encouraging equitable participation in science and engineering continues to inspire and uplift researchers, practitioners, and students alike.

Congratulations to Patricia for this well-deserved recognition!


*This award was established to honor the legacy of Barbora Buhnova, an extraordinary leader, inspiring colleague, and passionate advocate for gender equity in tech. Her remarkable efforts in gender balance, women empowerment, and community building—through initiatives like Czechitas and her leadership in EUGAIN — left a profound and lasting impact on the ICSA community and beyond. Barbora’s vision and dedication continue to shape and inspire the values celebrated by this award.*
