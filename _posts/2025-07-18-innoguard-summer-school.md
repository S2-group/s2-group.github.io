The [InnoGuard project](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101169233), a European Union initiative funded through the MSCA Doctoral Networks, is dedicated to advancing Accountable Cyber-Physical Systems (ACPS). As part of its ongoing commitment to excellence in research and collaboration, the project recently held its 2025 InnoGuard Summer School, hosted at Simula in Oslo.

This week-long programme brought together the project’s PhD candidates and supervisors for a dynamic curriculum designed to accelerate technical expertise, foster high-impact research, and strengthen professional networks.

## 🛠️ Bridging Technical Skills with Theory

One of the key technical highlights was the "Hands-on with LeoRover" session led by Chenglie Lu and Pablo Valle. Participants engaged directly with ROS (Robot Operating System) programming, gaining valuable hands-on experience in robotics and autonomous systems—core areas for the InnoGuard project.

Complementing these technical sessions, Pablo Sanchez delivered a workshop on effective dissemination strategies, and Miren Ivankovic conducted a session on network development, equipping students with tools for collaboration and increased scientific visibility.

## 🏭 Connecting Research with Industry

A standout feature of the programme was the “Visiting Industrialist – DNV” session presented by Shaukat Ali, Simula Chief Research Scientist and Research Professor. This session offered valuable insights into how academic research translates into real-world industrial impact.

Each PhD student presented their research plans to the DNV team, establishing direct dialogue and feedback on the industrial relevance of their work on ACPS. These interactions were followed by ideation workshops, co-led by Aitor Arrieta and Shaukat Ali, where students collaboratively developed and refined innovative research ideas.
