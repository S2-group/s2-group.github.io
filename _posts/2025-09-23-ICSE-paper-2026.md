## 🔬 Study Highlights

🐍 We measure the **energy usage** of Python code generated by LLMs compared to human-written code.  

🤖 We evaluate **363 solutions** to **9 coding problems** from the EvoEval benchmark using **6 LLMs** with **4 prompting techniques**, comparing them to human-developed solutions.  

💻 The evaluation spans **3 hardware platforms**: a server, a PC, and a Raspberry Pi — totaling over **36 days of experimentation**.

## 💡 Key Findings

- 🟢 Human expert code remains **the most energy-efficient**, outperforming all LLM-generated code by **17% to 30%**.  

- 🤖 **LLMs outperform average human developers** on some platforms, but still lag behind green-expert solutions.  

- ⚙️ **Prompt engineering does not consistently improve energy efficiency**. 

- 🌩️ **Human expertise is still crucial** for developing energy-efficient Python code.
