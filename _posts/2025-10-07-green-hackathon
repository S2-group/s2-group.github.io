# üå± Green Hackathon Report

## Event Summary
On October 7, the **Green Hackathon** was hosted as part of the Green Lab course in the Master of Computer Science program.  
Students participated actively, sharing innovative sustainability ideas and engaging in thoughtful discussions.  
The event fostered collaboration, creativity, and an inspiring atmosphere centered around **green software innovation**.

---

## Overview
The **Green Hackathon** encourages students to design **innovative, sustainability-focused software concepts**.  
Rather than implementing solutions, teams focus on creativity, impact, and societal relevance.  
Each group identifies a sustainability problem, proposes a novel software-based idea, and presents its potential contribution to greener computing.

## Project Descriptions

### GreenPrompt - Making AI Greener at the Human‚ÄìModel Interface
LLMs consume significant energy, but users don‚Äôt see the cost. GreenPrompt wants to be a lightweight SLM companion that rewrites/optimizes prompts locally before sending them to the LLM. It does so by guiding users to shorter, structured, greener prompts with minimal accuracy loss.

### ClearSky
In a world were people spend most of their time in front of a screen, this is a game that rewards putting down your phone. Your screen time clouds the digital sky, and every unplugged minute clears it.
If attention is the new currency, energy is the hidden tax. ClearSky turns that hidden tax into a living visual.

### Sustainable heating for ‚ÄúFree‚Äù - IT for Sustainability
Electricity prices and carbon emissions fluctuate throughout the day, with cleaner periods aligning with high renewables output. The idea is to automate schedules for devices to avoid extreme prices. A smart boiler, for example, can automatically schedule heating for low-price, low-carbon times.
It‚Äôs easy to install‚Äîsimply replace the old unit and connect it to Wi-Fi.

### GreenLint: Code Smarter, Save Energy & Save the Planet
A revolutionary Python linter that makes your code energy-efficient automatically. Where clean code meets clean energy for a sustainable future.
